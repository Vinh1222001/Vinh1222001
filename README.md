## HI THERE, WELCOME TO MY PAGE ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I am a final year student at **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology** majoring in **Computer Engineering ðŸ’»**.

Currently, I am seeking internship opportunities in positions such as **_Frontend Developer Intern_**, **_UI/UX Desiginer Intern_** or related positions.

Through my studies and personal projects, I have acquired knowledge in:

- `HTML5`
- `CSS3`, `Sass`, `Tailwind`
- `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`
- `ReactJS`
- `NextJS`
- `WordPress`
- `Figma`

Among these technologies, I am most confident in ReactJS, NextJS, and Figma.

My moderate enthusiasm for learning helps me adapt to new technologies, while my logical thinking supports problem-solving. Additionally, my average English skills allow me to communicate adequately within teams. Committed to working at least 20 hours per week, I'm excited about the chance to apply my skills and grow with your business.
